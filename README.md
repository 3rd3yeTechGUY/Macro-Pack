# Macro-Pack
# ~~NOTICE~~  This is a simple macro script coded in AHK. To run it, you must download AutoHotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/  Is this safe? Yes, on the AutoHotkey site itself it says it's just a programming language, it even says under the download button "is it safe?"  Click on it and it will redirect you to the Norton Rating Site even there it says "OK, SAFE"    For the people wondering  Norton Rating  Safeweb Share  Norton Safe Web has analyzed autohotkey.com/download for safety and security problems. The Norton rating is a result of NortonLifeLock's automated analysis system. Learn more.  The opinions of our users are reflected separately in the community rating on the right.    Is the script itself safe? Yes, all it does is press "e" and "left click" for you when you hold down the buttons. I know you can automate it and make it into one script, but i think when you do that you have less control over the situations.    # ~~INFO~~  Version 1.0  Not patched  UP TO DATE   # ~~HOW TO USE~~  Edit key needs to be "e"  you hold "E" and "G" at the same time when you opened the game and packs.   Have Fun and   Thanks For Using Purple's Autohotkey script
